[comment]: <> (Nextpuzzle.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.)

[comment]: <> (- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.)
[comment]: <> (- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.)

[comment]: <> (Importantly, Nextpuzzle.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Nextpuzzle.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.)
