I fell in love with miniature painting when my husband convinced me to try [**HeroQuest**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeroQuest).
Then I tried to paint one-color mini-figures from a board game.
That was it. I was hooked.

I am passionate about painting miniature figures and game items, mostly in 28mm format. Sometimes I "speed paint", sometimes I spend more time and with more technical painting methods on my "minis".

Here is a gallery of several of my miniatures [![(../images/icons8-brush-64.png)](../images/icons8-brush-64.png)](/paint-gallery)
Here is my Instagram [![(../images/icons8-instagram.svg)](../images/icons8-instagram.svg)]()

Maybe now I'm just a beginner artist, but I'm trying to achieve a professional level of my work.
